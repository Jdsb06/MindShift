This is a fantastic implementation. The UI is clean, adheres perfectly to the dark-mode "vibe," and the core pillars are all present and functional. You have successfully built the strong foundation we mapped out.

Now, to make MindShift the **best of the best** in its domain, we need to go beyond the MVP and build features that create unparalleled value, insight, and a 'sticky' user experience. The goal is to evolve from a simple log into an indispensable partner for the user's well-being and growth.

Here is a list of next-level functions, categorized from enhancing the core to introducing new dimensions.

---

### ## Tier 1: Deepen the Core Experience

These features enhance the pillars you've already built, making them more insightful and interconnected.

#### **1. Momentum Log Tags & Filtering**
* **What it is:** Allow users to add tags to their momentum entries (e.g., `#work`, `#health`, `#learning`, `#social`).
* **Why it's best-in-class:** It transforms the Momentum Log from a simple list into a personal data analytics tool. The user can filter their log by a tag to see exactly where their energy and time have been going. This provides powerful self-insight without the pressure of a traditional time-tracker. It answers the question, "Am I actually spending time on the things that matter to me?"
* **Implementation:** Add a small tag input field below the main momentum input. Display tags as clickable lozenges on each log entry.

#### **2. The Compass-Momentum Link**
* **What it is:** When a user adds a momentum entry, give them the option to link it directly to one of their three Compass goals.
* **Why it's best-in-class:** This is the feature that **closes the loop** between daily actions and long-term ambition. It makes the user's "why" tangible. You can then visualize this by showing a small progress indicator or a count next to each Compass goal (e.g., "14 steps taken towards this goal"). It provides a massive dopamine hit and reinforces that small efforts lead to big results.
* **Implementation:** Below the momentum input, show three small, clickable buttons representing the user's Compass goals.

#### **3. Evolve "AI Magic" to "AI Coach"**
* **What it is:** Go beyond one-off summaries. Use the AI to provide gentle, Socratic, weekly reflections.
* **Why it's best-in-class:** This positions your AI as a true partner. At the end of the week, a Cloud Function can analyze the user's tagged logs and linked goals to generate a personalized insight like:
    * *"I noticed that 7 of your 10 entries this week were linked to your 'Launch my project' goal. That's incredible focus. How did that feel?"*
    * *"It looks like you put a lot of energy into `#work` this week. Remember to make some time for your `#health` goal too. No pressure at all, just a gentle reminder."*
* **Implementation:** Create a new weekly trigger for your AI Cloud Function and a new section on the dashboard to display these weekly insights.

### ## Tier 2: Introduce New Dimensions

These are major new features that add powerful new reasons for a user to engage with the app daily.

#### **1. The "Unwind" Protocol (The True "Attention Swap")**
* **What it is:** A dedicated section or full-screen modal triggered by a "Feeling Overwhelmed?" or "Reset Focus" button. This protocol offers a menu of 2-5 minute, evidence-based tools for nervous system regulation.
* **Why it's best-in-class:** This makes MindShift a genuine mental health utility. It's no longer just for tracking productivity; it's a tool for actively managing stress and anxiety in the moment. It directly combats the mindless scroll by offering a healthier, more effective alternative.
* **Implementation:**
    * **Box Breathing:** A simple visualizer that animates a shape expanding and contracting to guide the user's breath.
    * **Ephemeral Journaling ("Brain Dump"):** A text box with a prompt like, "What's on your mind? Let it all out." The text could slowly fade away after 5 minutes, symbolizing letting go of intrusive thoughts.
    * **5-Senses Grounding:** A guided walkthrough of the 5-4-3-2-1 grounding technique.

#### **2. The "Look Back" - Weekly/Monthly Review**
* **What it is:** An automatically generated, beautifully designed summary of the user's week or month.
* **Why it's best-in-class:** It powerfully counters the feeling of "I was busy all month but have nothing to show for it." This feature visually proves their progress. It could include:
    * A pie chart of their Momentum Tags.
    * A highlight of their biggest "win" (you can ask them to star one entry per day).
    * Their most impactful AI insight.
    * A simple count of their total accomplishments.
* **Implementation:** A scheduled Cloud Function that aggregates data and a new view/page to display this report. Make it easily shareable as an image.

### ## Tier 3: Enhance the "Vibe" & Personalization

These features focus on delight, aesthetics, and making the app feel uniquely "theirs."

#### **1. Customizable Themes**
* **What it is:** Let the user change the primary accent color of the UI.
* **Why it's best-in-class:** This directly delivers on the "Maximalist" part of our "Minimalist Maximalism" design philosophy. It's a simple change that dramatically increases a user's sense of ownership and personal connection to the app.
* **Implementation:** In a settings menu, provide 5-6 curated, vibrant color swatches (e.g., Indigo, Magenta, Teal, Amber) that update the CSS variables for the accent color throughout the app.

#### **2. The Momentum Heatmap**
* **What it is:** A visual, GitHub-style contribution graph that shows a colored square for every day the user logged at least one momentum entry.
* **Why it's best-in-class:** It's a powerful, non-judgmental visualization of consistency. It's not about *how much* you did, but that you *showed up*. Seeing an unbroken chain or a sea of colored squares is incredibly motivating and doesn't induce the anxiety of a "streak" that can be broken.
* **Implementation:** A new component on the dashboard that fetches log data and maps it to a calendar grid.
