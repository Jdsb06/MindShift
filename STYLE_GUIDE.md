# Style Guide

## Frontend
- React with functional components and hooks
- Keep components small; lift state thoughtfully
- Tailwind for utility-first styling; keep classes readable
- Prefer semantic HTML and accessible components
- Smooth, subtle transitions over heavy animations

## Backend
- Validate inputs and `context.auth` early
- Keep functions small and purposeful
- Log actionable messages, not noise
- Fail fast and return helpful errors

## Documentation
- Keep docs pragmatic, concise, and current
- Use fenced code blocks for commands and code
- Prefer plain language; avoid jargon
