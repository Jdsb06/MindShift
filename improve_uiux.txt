This is a phenomenal evolution of the app! You've successfully integrated the more advanced features like the Compass-Momentum link and the Momentum Heatmap. The functionality is clearly there.

Now, to elevate the UI/UX from **functional and clean** to **intuitive, delightful, and "best-in-class,"** we can focus on reducing cognitive load, increasing visual feedback, and doubling down on the core philosophy of "no-pressure productivity."

Here is a detailed UI/UX improvement prompt based on your latest screenshots.

### ## Design Improvement Prompt: MindShift v2

**Objective:** Refine the existing dashboard to feel more fluid, rewarding, and emotionally supportive. Reduce visual clutter and transform data readouts into delightful moments of positive reinforcement.

### ### 1. Overall Vibe & Polish

**Critique:** The layout is well-organized but very boxy. The flat colors are clean but can feel a bit static.
**Suggestion:** Introduce more "air" and "softness."
* **Increase Padding:** Slightly increase the internal padding within each card (`Your Compass`, `Momentum Log`, etc.). This gives the content more room to breathe and feels less dense.
* **Subtle Gradients:** On the primary buttons (`Edit Goals`, `Add`), apply a very subtle gradient of your accent color (e.g., from indigo to a slightly lighter violet). This adds depth and makes them feel more premium and clickable.
* **Interactive Glow:** When a user hovers over a button or an interactive element, add a soft outer glow (`box-shadow` with a blur) of the accent color. This makes the interface feel alive and responsive.

### ### 2. Your Compass: From Information to Reward

**Critique:** The "1 step taken" text is purely informational and small. It's data, not a celebration.
**Suggestion:** Visualize the progress directly on the goal.
* **The Progress Ring:** Replace the "X steps taken" text with a **glowing progress ring** around the central icon (`üéØ`, `‚≠ê`). Each time a momentum entry is linked to that goal, the ring fills up a little more. For example, if a user decides 10 steps complete a goal, each step fills 10% of the ring. This visual is instantly understandable and feels much more rewarding than reading text.

### ### 3. Momentum Log: Streamline the Workflow

**Critique:** The input area is segmented into three parts (win, tags, link), which is functional but can feel like filling out a form.
**Suggestion:** Create a single, "Smart Input" field.
* **Unified Input:** Have only one main input field for the "win."
* **Inline Triggers:** Teach the user to use special characters to add metadata fluidly, just like in apps like Slack or Notion.
    * Typing **`#`** could automatically bring up a small dropdown of their existing tags (`#work`, `#gym`) or allow them to create a new one.
    * Typing **`@`** could bring up a dropdown of their three Compass goals to link to.
* **Why this is best-in-class:** This dramatically cleans up the UI and makes the process of adding a detailed log feel incredibly fast and "magical." It's an expert-level UX pattern that respects the user's time and intelligence.

### ### 4. Momentum Heatmap: From Performance Report to "Presence" Visualization

**Critique:** The stats section (`Consistency`, `Current Streak`) feels like a performance report. "Streak" in particular can create anxiety, as breaking it feels like a failure. This goes against our core philosophy.
**Suggestion:** Reframe the metrics to celebrate "presence" over "performance."
* **Remove Pressure Metrics:** **Delete "Consistency %" and "Current Streak."** These are the most likely to cause anxiety.
* **Rephrase Gentle Metrics:**
    * Keep "Active Days" and "Total Entries."
    * Change "Longest Streak" to **"Longest Run"** or **"Longest Momentum."** The word "run" feels less fragile and intimidating than "streak."
* **Implement the Heatmap Gradient:** The squares are currently all one color. Make them use a gradient based on the number of entries. Use your primary accent color with varying opacity (e.g., 1 entry = 20% opacity, 2 = 40%, 3 = 60%, etc.). This makes the visual much richer and more informative at a glance.
* **Add Hover Interaction:** When the user hovers over a square, show a tooltip with the date and the number of entries (e.g., "4 wins on August 5th").

### ### 5. AI Coach: From Functions to Invitations

**Critique:** The buttons are functional but a bit generic. The lock icons (`üîí`) are confusing‚Äîare these paid features or something else?
**Suggestion:** Make the buttons feel like clear, enticing invitations.
* **Use Action-Oriented Language:**
    * `Look Back` ‚Üí `‚ú® My Monthly Rewind`
    * `Weekly Reflection` ‚Üí `AI Coach Check-in`
    * `Quick Vibe` ‚Üí `Instant Insight`
* **Remove Confusing Icons:** Get rid of the lock icons unless they are truly locked features. If they are, the UI must explain how to unlock them. If they aren't, they are just creating unnecessary friction and confusion. Replace them with the icons we've already established (`‚ú®`, `üßò‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è`).
* **Add a "First-Time" Hint:** For a new user, you could add a small pulsing dot on the "AI Coach Check-in" button with a tooltip that says, "Get your first reflection after 7 days of entries!" This manages expectations and encourages engagement.
